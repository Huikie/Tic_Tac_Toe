# Tic Tac Toe app

## Explanation of the app
This is a basic game of tic-tac-toe, where two players take turns pressing buttons in a 3x3 grid to mark “X” (player one) or “O” (player two) characters on them respectively. If any player can place three of their letters in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, that player wins the game. Two players can also draw when 9 moves are played and there is still no winner.

## Implemented extra's
- In the app I give the users feedback about the gamestate in a nice way.

This extra is shown in the section "Screenshots of the app" (all images).
