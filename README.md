## Tic Tac Toe app

This is a basic game of tic-tac-toe, where two players take turns pressing buttons in a 3x3 grid to mark “X” or “O” characters on them respectively. If any player can place three of their letters in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, that player wins the game. Two players can also draw geen 9 moves are played and there is still no winner.
